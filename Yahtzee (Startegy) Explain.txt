YAHTZEE STRATEGY - Based on Probability Theory.
The Probability of Finding a Large Straight or Small Straight is Higher.
Which is about 28% Chance to find a Small Straight after we have found a Three of a Kind or Two of a Kind.
and 9% Chance to find a Large Straight after we have found a Three of a Kind or a Two of a Kind.

First Roll is Decided by the Rarest Kind to achieve.

1. Find out which number is most frequent in the first roll using the HighestMultiplicity Function from Assignment 1.
2. Finding Pairs - 
3. If Pair is Found, Continue to comparing other dices to find more one of a kind dices.
4. If no Two Dices have the Same value - Algorithm looks for Large Straights or Small Straights.
5. Other wise Reroll and Find a better Score.

Current Score - 169.79
